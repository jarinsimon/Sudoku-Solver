Basic: Hardcode start of board 

for each empty tile
	for number 1-9	
		try number i
		check if i is valid inside board space (check if i appears in row, column, box)
		//if any check fails, then move to next number
	if all numbers fail
		clear current space
		backtrack and move back a space
	else tile is valid
	move to next tile

Future: Randomize board, change number of given tiles

functions:
finding which tiles are empty

validation of tile
